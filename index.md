# About 

Hi there! 

I'm a graduate student in the [McKay Lab](https://mckaylab.web.unc.edu) at the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I study the epigenetics of gene regulation during 
*Drosophila* development using a mixture of wet-lab and computational techniques.
My project has focused on understanding how the 
steroid hormone ecdysone can induce temporal- and tissue-specific gene expression responses.
