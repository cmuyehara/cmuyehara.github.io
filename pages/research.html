<h1>Research</h1>

<div class="justify">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Broadly, my research in the McKay Lab is focused on the epigenetic regulation of
tissue- and temporal-specific gene expression profiles during development.
My work uses genomics to develop a high-level understanding
of biological processes and combines it with targeted molecular biology experiments to
validate and expand upon specific questions.
</p>

<p> 
More specifically, I research how ecdysone hormone signaling in the fruit fly, 
<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, elicits different metamorphic responses throughout
the animal and over time. 
</p>

<h2>Questions:</h2>
<ul class='double' style='line-height:1.5'> 
	<li>How does the ecdysone receptor (EcR) coordinate temporal- and tissue-
		specific gene expression responses?</li>
		<ul><li>Is its binding dynamic across time and between tissues?</li></ul>
	<li>How does EcR regulate individual enhancers?</li>
		<ul><li>Does it regulate their temporal activity?</li></ul>
	<li>What dictates where EcR binds?</li>
</ul>

		This enhancer from the <i>Delta (Dl)</i> locus is beautifully patterned.
		A) Browser shot of EcR CUT&RUN from <i>Drosophila</i> wings at the <i>Delta</i> locus. <i>Dl<sup>SOP</sup></i> is highlighted.
		B) <i>Dl<sup>SOP</sup></i> driving nls::GFP (green) compared to <i>Ac</i>, a marker of proneural clusters.
		C) <i>Dl<sup>SOP</sup></i> driving destabalized GFP (dsGFP) compared to <i>Dl</i> protein. When driving dsGFP, 
			<i>Dl<sup>SOP</sup></i> is active only in a few cells that we believe correspond to the sensory organ precursor.

The basis for my project was a landmark
paper by <a href=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/science/article/pii/S1534580713006060?via%3Dihub" class = extLink>McKay and Lieb in 2013</a>
in which they showed that the leg, wing, and haltere imaginal discs had chromatin accessibility profiles that were nearly identical.
